## Language Rules

Any grammatically correct text in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language](Russian) is perfectly valid
`rulang` code.

## Compiler

This is the main struggle. At the moment we don't know how to run `rulang` software at computer. Most probably
we need a strong AI to correctly compile `rulang` code.

## Injecting into Sites

You can freely inject any amount of `rulang` code to any site as long as you add `humans.txt` file according to
[http://humanstxt.org/Standard.html](Standard), adding `rulang` as `Computer Language` or `Components`.

It is required to add to HTML of the pages with `rulang` code parts:

```
<html lang="ru-UA">
```

and

```
<meta http-equiv="content-language" content="ru-UA">
```
